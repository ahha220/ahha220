Hi! I'm currently working on a personal portfolio, but for now, here's some of my favourite video projects I've worked on. Stay tuned for when a website comes out showcasing some UI/UX designs, graphics, and more videos.

Power!

I made this with After Effects, and I really liked the layering of vectors/elements on this + (nice flow I guess.)

DECA Executive Promotion Video

I also made this with After Effects. This got quite a bit of views when we started from a low following.

Student Council Election Videos

I, again, used After Effects for these videos. Glad to know the student body thought they were entertaining (think I grabbed their attention pretty well). 

This was a remake of one of Apple's iPhone ads. ðŸ˜„

Took some inspiration from New Jeans here.

Here's the design to the project that won me Top 10 for DECA Ontario! Pretty nice (the web-app is a little janky right now, but I'm hoping to re-program it as a future project and make it more functional! + add some frameworks too and learn a bit more about front-end harhar.)

I love creativity, and I'm striving to learn more about front-end to combine these two. More creativity projects coming too. Dabble in some hardware too.
